\begin{abstract}
The contemporary landscape of virtual world design is characterized by the ubiquity of diverse tools and terrain design engines, which have significantly reduced the barriers to entry in this domain. Despite this progress, the predominant input modalities of mice and keyboards fail to provide users with haptic feedback during the processes of designing, testing, and experiencing virtual environments. Addressing this limitation, we introduce HaptiEditor, a virtual terrain editing tool that integrates haptic feedback through the utilization of force-feedback capabilities offered by the Haply 2Diy device, implemented within the Unity game engine framework. Our primary objective is to enhance both the design process and the evaluative capacity of designers, as well as to enrich the immersive engagement of users or players navigating these virtual worlds.
