This project attempts to deliver on a haptics focused terrain editing experience first and foremost. The overaching approach was to first establish a reliable coupling via a virtual proxy to Unity's physics system, and then create a proof of concept terrain editing tool which is driven by the aforementioned virtual proxy.

The three fundamental questions we had were as follows:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item How would we design a generic virtual coupling between Unity's physics engine and the Haply's force feedback mechanisms?
    \item How would we detect and render textures in realtime?
    \item How would we design the tool itself, with the main mode of interaction being through the Haply?
\end{enumerate}
